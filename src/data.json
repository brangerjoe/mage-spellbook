Prime creates an aetheric matrix for insubstantial things to pass through (namely electronic money), and then Correspondence covers an area for Entropy to move the money around in. The Forces 3 version is more brute force, and directly sends signals that the bills have been paid. It is much riskier, but possible, to use this to make money rather than just to pay bills."
