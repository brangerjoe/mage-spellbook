It has a threshold of seven successes, before duration is considered. Entropy and Life give the Mage the mystical attributes of death, and Spirit allows the Mage to cross the Shroud. The Mage exists for all purposes as a Wraith, inhabiting a corpus with 10 health levels and no wound penalties. The Spirit sphere is necessary to heal any wounds that the Mage sustains. Ghosts, however, can sense that the Mage is still among the living with a Perception + Awareness roll. As a Wraith, the Mage may walk through solid barriers at a cost of a single Health level. If the Mage loses all their Health levels, the Mage gains a new Entropy Synergy trait and is then drawn into a Harrowing, which is a kind of anti-Seeking: a symbolic vision quest where the purpose is to cause the Mage to embrace Oblivion rather than the spur them to personal Enlightenment. If the Mage succeeds, the effect ends, and they are brought back to their physical body. If they fail, that is, they reject their Avatar or deny Ascension, they make a Willpower roll at difficulty 9. If they succeed, the effect ends and they (and any companions) return to their body. If they fail, they return to their body and lose a level of Arete. With a botch, Oblivion consumes the Mage, and their body dies, and they become a Spectre."},{"name":"Death's Passage","category":"Movement and Communication","subcategory":"Shadowlands Travel","books":["The Swashbuckler's Handbook page 93"],"sphereCostRaw":"Entropy 4, Spirit 3, Life 2","sphereCost":[[{"name":"Entropy","cost":4},{"name":"Spirit","cost":3},{"name":"Life","cost":2}]],"description":"An extreme technique for bypassing walls, this allows the Mage to step into the Underworld in order to get around.

The extra arms give the Mage four extra dice on unarmed and Melee dice pools. Additional successes may be spent to add two dice to these dice pools by making the Mage more coordinated in their use. Three more successes must be spent to create an aura of supernatural fear around the Mage, causing Sleepers to flee and others to require a Willpower roll at difficulty 6 with a minimum of three successes to avoid doing so. An additional success is needed to power it at all, along with three points on quintessence. The ritual to invoke this is time consuming, as it requires many successes, and so it is often combined with Time so that the effect may be prepared in advance of a battle.
